### A simulation study on modelling lagged effects in time series analysis

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A simulation study comparing methods to model lagged effects in environmental time series studies, specifically moving averages and distributed lag linear and non-linear models (DLMs and DLNMs). The code fully reproduces the results illustrated in the article:

Gasparrini A. Modelling lagged associations in environmental time series data: a simulation study. *Epidemiology*. 2016; **27**(6):835-842. [[freely available here](http://www.ag-myresearch.com/2016_gasparrini_epidem.html)]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code:

-   *example.R* offers an example of simulation of the data, fit of the models, and display/summary of the results
-   the numbered files from *00.prep.R* to *05.supplemenatary.R*, to be run sequentially, fully reproduce the results of the simulation study presented in the manuscript
